# TryHackMe – Crossed Wires: The XSS Lab  
Room Link: [https://tryhackme.com/jr/48352](https://tryhackme.com/jr/48352)

---
## Summary

*Crossed Wires* is a fully interactive TryHackMe room that teaches Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through hands-on exercises. It covers theory, exploitation, and mitigation of:
- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- DOM-based XSS
- Filter bypasses
- Framework-specific vulnerabilities
- Mitigation techniques (CSP, sanitization, encoding)

---

## Learning Outcomes

### Knowledge Outcomes:
- In-depth understanding of XSS types and risks
- Knowledge of modern app vulnerabilities
- Insights into how attackers bypass input filters

### Practical Skills:
- Crafting JavaScript/HTML payloads
- Identifying XSS via source inspection and browser dev tools
- Evading filters using encoding and event-based tricks
- Detecting unsafe rendering in React, Vue, Angular
- Implementing real-world mitigation strategies

## Final Challenge

- **Exploit Code:** `<script>revealSecret()</script>`
- **Discovered Password:** `{Password@3356b62_}`

---

## Reflection

This project helped me understand XSS from both attacker and developer perspectives. I gained confidence in crafting payloads, bypassing filters, and thinking like a secure coder. The lab also emphasized the importance of input validation and safe DOM handling in real-world development.
